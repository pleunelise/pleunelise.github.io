          Project 1 HTML CSS
        </b>
        <img src="images\plaatje1.png" alt="Eerste html css pagina" height="200" width="300">
        In the first year of coderclass we started with HTML CSS. Hereby was a project linked, the client of this project was Pasta Vino.
        We had to work in groups of 5 to make a HTML CSS page and we needed to stick to the order of the client.
        We each started to make a wireframe to compare afterwards and make a final wireframe who everybody liked.
        Then we all started to work on a page, we made a division of tasks in a trello board.
        My task was to make the page about the history and about the food they serve.
        I did not work on the CSS (I do know the basics), that was someone else his job.

        <img src="images\blenderlogo.png" alt="blender logo" height="200" width="200">
        In the second period we also had a project liked to a module.
        By this project we got the assignment from SOS kinderdorpen (child villages).
        The theme of the assignment was blenderspeakssyria.
        We could choose between different topics where we want to make our animation about.
        After a short discussion we came with a solution. We would have out animation about 'no shelter'.
        This topic appealed to us.
        The task division went well, only the deadlines went a little less, because we weren't used to them.

          Project 3 Data visualization in Python
        </b>
        <img src="images\fietsengestolenp.m..png" alt="Zelfgemaakt grafiek" height="180" width="230">
        In the third period came my favourite project from the first year of middle school (7th grade in the USA).
        The project was about data visualization in python.
        For the kiskoff of this project we went to Ortec.
        Arrived at Ortec the assignment got explained.
        We had to make all different graphs about bike thefts in Rotterdam.
        We worked in Pycharm edu. By this project went all the deadlines well and there were no problems.
        The task division was very equal.
        With this project I leared many fun and new things.
